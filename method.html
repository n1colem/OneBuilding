			<p>Most people realize that architecture is no longer being designed on the drafting board by hand and pencil. Nowadays, almost all buildings are designed in a digital environment. But what exactly does that mean? How many files does it take to design one building? What kind of software is involved? How many emails does it take? When do they send them? How much space does it take up, and what are the largest files? How many files came from other projects, or with the software? How do these metrics change over the various phases of the design and construction process? 
The purpose of this project is to help people visualize and explore the files involved in creating one building. Born-digital architectural projects are just now beginning to be collected by museums and archives; issues may arise (and opportunities may be lost) as institutions adapt methods and policies for non-digital architectural material to born-digital work. Not only is it important for collecting institutions to grasp the scope of a projectâ€™s files in order to make more informed appraisal decisions, but also to leverage and preserve the metadata automatically generated by the digital process to create novel ways of accessing, analyzing, and understanding archival material.
